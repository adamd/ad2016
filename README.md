# ad2016

In 2007, it seemed like everybody was announcing that they were running for president super early. And they were using all the new social websites like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter.

As a parody, I decided [I was running for president](https://www.adamduvander.com/me/im-running-for-president/).

But since I was too young at the time, I announced it for 2016, not 2008. And [I made a website](http://2016.adamduvander.com) that was meant to be very 2007. I'm not sure it was ever very funny, but it was definitely funnier then.
